# freja

Self-modifiable text editor implemented in Janet.

## try it

### prerequisites

Janet -- https://janet-lang.org/

### installation

```
[sudo] jpm install https://github.com/Saikyun/freja
```

If you get an old version, try running `[sudo] jpm clear-cache` before re-running the above command.

### steps to run from source

```
git clone https://github.com/Saikyun/freja
cd freja
mkdir janet_libs
JANET_PATH=./janet_libs jpm deps
JANET_PATH=./janet_libs jpm build
JANET_PATH=./janet_libs janet src/main.janet
```

### changing the theme

NOTE: Use `Ctrl` on Windows / Linux and `Cmd` on MacOS.

1. Start the editor
   1. Linux / MacOS: `mkdir ~/.freja && freja ~/.freja/init.janet`
1. Copy the following into the file
```
(import freja/theme :prefix "")

(merge-into colors
            @{:text (rgba 248 248 243)
              :border [0.396 0.478 0.513]
              :background (rgba 39 40 33)
              :textarea [0.992 0.965 0.88]
              :selected-text [0.992 0.965 0.88]
              :selected-text-background :blue
              :caret [0.396 0.478 0.513]
              
              :game-bg (rgba 134 173 172)
              
              :call (rgba 166 226 45)
              :special-symbol (rgba 102 217 238)
              :string (rgba 230 219 115)
              :keyword (rgba 174 128 255)})
```
3. Press `Ctrl/Cmd+L`
4. Press a button to force the text area to rerender

The above is a port of the Monokai theme by Wimer Hazenberg.

## Evaluation environment

Whenever you run hit `Ctrl/Cmd+L` you run `freja/file_handling/save-and-dofile`.  
This saves the file, and then runs the file using janet's `dofile`.  
This leads to a new environment table being created (using `make-env`).  
This environment table is then used whenever you hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter`,  
which calls `freja/input/eval-it`.  
`eval-it` will run the code to the left of the cursor, specifically,  
a symbol, keyword, string, number, struct, table, tuple (including a function call), or array.  

Some examples:
```
# | is the cursor
1 2| 3
# eval-it
#=> 2

"a b c"|
# eval-it
#=> "a b c"

"a b| c"
# eval-it
#=> b is undefined

(+ 1 2 3)|
# eval-it
#=> 6
```
This can be very useful when trying to run example code in files,  
or just play around with the code.

The main way to use this is to open a file, hit `Ctrl/Cmd+L`  
which will make Freja look at the environment of that file.  
Successive calls to `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter` will then act in that environment.  
If you want to reset the environment (i.e. clear away `def` calls  
you made using `Ctrl/Cmd+Ã‰nter`), you can reload the file using  
`Ctrl/Cmd+L` again.
